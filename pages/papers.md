##  Against Bias Related Harm...

I co-wrote and presented [this paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2pc4m4cg) (DOI below) for the 2023, Spatial Data Science Symposium: http://sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net/.

- **TITLE**: Using a narrative-based approach as a safeguard against bias related harm in algorithmic tools and services

- **ABSTRACT**: "The ubiquity of algorithmic tools and services (ATS) in spatial data science has led to increased concerns about the biases they carry. This vision paper explores the biases inherent in ATS, encompassing computational, statistical, human, and systemic biases, and those compounded by multinational corporations. It underscores the imperative to address these biases, advocating a narrative-based approach to counteract them and promote equitable outcomes. This approach not only heightens awareness of embedded biases but also charts a course toward their mitigation."

- **KEYWORDS**: Bias, Deep Learning, Disability Inclusion, Intersectionality, Machine Learning, Mental Model, User Experience
