# Sprint Planning

My thesis proposal is coming along, and while that's in progress, one of my side jobs is working at a startup to develop a 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP) using Scrum methodology.

While researching how to plan delivery iterations (sprints), I came across this gem of a blog post. It explains how iterations should be planned to create usable outputs that can be tested 'early and often.'

The post's top row illustrates sprint deliveries that are untestable (like a wheel, do we balance on it?), preventing evaluation until the very end. In contrast, the second row demonstrates the opposite approach, providing immediate feedback. 

The facial expressions in the visuals were perfect: a genius use of visual variables! (Jacques Bertin would have approved!)
